Building project AI elements 

Profession adviser

## Summary:

As society evolves more and more, higher education is necessary for jobs. But choose correctly can be difficult especially when you are a young person. AI through could long term follow your passions, give you questionnaires, better introduce aspects of professions and give you some recommendations.

## Background: 

Choosing the right career can bring many positives. You are happier, you enjoy work more, it generally makes company/state more prosperous, effective. Every individual has unique characteristics that makes him for some jobs more suitable, successful.

What brought me to this problem is my uncertainty about whether I'm choosing correctly what to study and whether I'm suitable for it given my capabilities. I often see among my schoolmates the same. 

## Data and AI techniques: 

  Data
    -personal: hobbies, psychological tests, your general skills (writing, logic, communication skills etc.), film or books you like
    -general: demand for the job, how evolving technologies can affect it, how successful people are in a specific profession

  AI techniques 
    -Neural Networks, supervised learning

## How is it used: 
Such an AI could help many young people who struggle when choosing a career.

## Challenges: 
Many data would be necessary to collect from people. As well to train AI we'd needed data of working people from their youth which is difficult. Memory might compromise the accuracy of data.

## What next: 
Achieving relevant results would be magnificent by itself enough. Improving accuracy and extend use among people would be the next steps.
